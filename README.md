# RecipeApp
RecipeApp is and android application that gives users random recipes to help them decide what to cook :-)

## Overview

RecipeApp consumes the api : https://spoonacular.com/food-api : 
  - It uses the endpoint /random
  - Using the api required an API key that we got simply by registering in the website. The  API key is hard coded in the Routing configuration

RecipesApp displays a random list of recipes . By clicking on each recipe, the user can get the following details:
- The time needed to prepare the meal
- The instructions of the recipe 
- Nutritional information : (vegetarian, vegan, dairy free, gluten free)
The health score of each recipe is displayed in the list. The score is a percentage provided by the food-api of spoonacular

## User stories
Two user stories are implemented in the app : 
- As a user, I want to get a list of recipes so that I decide what to cook
- As a user, I want to get details about the recipe so that I know its instructions and nutrional information
