# RecipeApp
RecipeApp is and android application that gives users random recipes to help them decide what to cook :-)

## Overview

RecipeApp consumes the api : https://spoonacular.com/food-api using the endpoint /random 
Using the api required an API key that we got simply by registering in the website. The  API key is hard coded in the Routing configuration

## User stories
Two user stories are implemented in the app : 
- As a user, I want to get a list of recipe so that I decide what tp cook
- As a user, I want to get details about the recipe so that I know its instructions and nutrional information
